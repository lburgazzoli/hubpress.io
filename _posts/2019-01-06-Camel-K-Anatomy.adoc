A few months ago a new species of camel which has the ability to survive to the extreme environmental conditions of modern cloud systems has been discovered and named *Camel K*.


== Introduction

From a 10000 foot view, we can describe *Camel K* as a cloud native integration platform based on https://camel.apache.org/[Apache Camel] that leverage the power of the https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk[Operator SDK] to run natively on https://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes] or https://www.openshift.com[OpenShift].

This is an introductory of a series of mini-post in which I'm going to dissect *Camel K* to explain its internal structure, for a better overview and information about what to expect next, I'd recommend the following posts by the awesome https://www.nicolaferraro.me[Nicola Ferraro]:

*Camel K" is 

* *Operator*
* *Traits*
* *Runtimes*


It coordinates all the moving parts that make it possible to create true cloud native integrations.
